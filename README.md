#Goal

A simple photo "tweaker" allowing to fast crop and resize an image and (eventually) apply a bunch of predefined filter.

This is not an image editor.

- crop
- canvas resize
- apply predefined filter
  - auto white
  - vintage
- one picture open per session
- undo
- effects are always on the full image (except red eyes?)
- expand the selection wotj keys
- rotate in 90Â° steps

Maybe:
- offer a way to open directly the image in gimp (or any other image editor)

No:
- zoom: always fills (proportions kept) the window,
